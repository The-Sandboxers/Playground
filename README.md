## Adjust Steam Profile Settings
In order for Playground to grab played games from your Steam profile, you will need to have game details for your Steam account set to be publicly visible. <br>
1. On your Steam profile, click the "Edit Profile" button to the right of your username and profile picture:

3. Ensure that both "My profile" and "Game details" are set to <b>Public</b>:

This may take some time to update in Steam's API in order to allow Playground to grab your played game information.
