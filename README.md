## Adjust Steam Profile Settings <a id="Steam"></a>
In order for Playground to grab played games from your Steam profile, you will need to have game details for your Steam account set to be publicly visible. <br>
1. On your Steam profile, click the "Edit Profile" button to the right of your username and profile picture:
![Edit Profile button](documentation/README_imgs/steam_editprofile.png)
2. Select the "Privacy Settings" menu option on the left side of the screen:
![Privacy Settings button](documentation/README_imgs/steam_privacysettings.png)
3. Ensure that both "My profile" and "Game details" are set to <b>Public</b>:

This may take some time to update in Steam's API in order to allow Playground to grab your played game information.
